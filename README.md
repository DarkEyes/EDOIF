Empirical Distribution Ordering Inference Framework (EDOIF)
===========================================================

[![minimal R version](https://img.shields.io/badge/R%3E%3D-3.5.0-6666ff.svg)](https://cran.r-project.org/)


EDOIF is  non-parametric  framework  based on  Esitmation Statistics principle. Its main purpose is to  infer orders of empirical distributions from different categories base on a probability of finding a value in one distribution that greater than the expectation of another distribution. Given a set of ordered-pair of real-category values the framework is capable of 

1) inferring orders of  domination  of  categories  and  representing  orders  in  the form of a graph; 
2) estimating  magnitude  of  difference  between  a  pair  of categories in forms of confidence intervals; and
3) visualizing  domination  orders  and  magnitudes  of  dif-ference of categories.

Installation
------------
Please call the following commands in R terminal.

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github('DarkEyes/EDOIF')
```


Examples
--------
``` r
library(EDOIF)

#==parameter setting
bootT=1000 # number of times of sample with replacement in bootstrap function.
alpha=0.05 # Significance level
nInv=1500 # number of samples per categories (there are five categories that are generated by SimNonNormalDist )

#======= input
simData3<-SimNonNormalDist(nInv=nInv,noisePer=0.01) # generating the simulation data

# Calling the class constructor
A3<-EDOIF(simData3$Values,simData3$Grou, bootT=bootT, alpha=alpha, methodType ="perc") 

# Visualizing results
print(A3) # print the results in text mode
plot(A3) # print the results in graphic mode
```
